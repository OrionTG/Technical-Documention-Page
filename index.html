            <p>At its heart, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTML">HTML</a> is a language
                made up of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Element">elements</a>, which can
                be applied to pieces of text to give them
                different meaning in a document (Is it a paragraph? Is it a bulleted list? Is it part of a table?),
                structure a document into logical sections (Does it have a header? Three columns of content? A
                navigation menu?), and embed content such as images and videos into a page. This module will introduce
                the first two of these and introduce fundamental concepts and syntax you need to know to understand
                HTML.</p>

            <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a markup language that tells web browsers how to structure the web
                pages you visit. It can be as complicated or as simple as the web developer wants it to be. HTML
                consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, wrap, or mark up different parts of content
                to make it appear or act in a certain way. The enclosing tags can make content into a hyperlink to
                connect to another page, italicize words, and so on. For example, consider the following line of text:
            </p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="">
            <header></header>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="">
            <header></header>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="">
            <header></header>
        </section>
    </main>
