            <p>At its heart, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTML">HTML</a> is a language
                made up of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Element">elements</a>, which can
                be applied to pieces of text to give them
                different meaning in a document (Is it a paragraph? Is it a bulleted list? Is it part of a table?),
                structure a document into logical sections (Does it have a header? Three columns of content? A
                navigation menu?), and embed content such as images and videos into a page. This module will introduce
                the first two of these and introduce fundamental concepts and syntax you need to know to understand
                HTML.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="what_is_html?">
            <header>What is HTML?</header>
            <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a markup language that tells web browsers how to structure the web
                pages you visit. It can be as complicated or as simple as the web developer wants it to be. HTML
                consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, wrap, or mark up different parts of content
                to make it appear or act in a certain way. The enclosing tags can make content into a hyperlink to
                connect to another page, italicize words, and so on. For example, consider the following line of text:
            </p>
            <code class="code">My cat is very grumpy</code>
            <p>If we wanted the line to stand by itself, we could specify that it is a paragraph by enclosing it in
                paragraph tags:</p>
            <code class="code">&lt;p&gt;My cat is very grumpy&lt;p&gt;</code>

            <section class="main-section" id="anatomy_of_an_html_element">
                <header>Anatomy of an HTML element</header>
                <p>Let's explore this paragraph element a bit further.</p>
                <img
                    src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics/grumpy-cat-small.png" />
                <p>The main parts of our element are as follows:</p>
                <ul class="list-style-number">
                    <li><b>The opening tag:</b> This consists of the name of the element (in this case, <code>p</code>),
                        wrapped in opening and
                        closing <b>angle brackets</b>. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect —
                        in
                        this case
                        where the paragraph begins.</li>
                    <li><b>The closing tag:</b> This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a
                        <i>forward
                            slash</i> before
                        the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends.
                        Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange
                        results.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>The content:</b> This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.</li>
                    <li><b>The element:</b> The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the
                        element.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Elements can also have attributes that look like the following:</p>
                <img
                    src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics/grumpy-cat-attribute-small.png" />
                <p>Attributes contain extra information about the element that you don't want to appear in the actual
                    content. Here, <code>class</code> is the attribute name and <code>editor-note</code> is the
                    attribute
                    value. The <code>class</code> attribute
                    allows you to give the element a non-unique identifier that can be used to target it (and any other
                    elements with the same <code>class</code> value) with style information and other things.</p>
                <p>An attribute should always have the following:</p>
                <ul class="list-style-number">
                    <li>A space between it and the element name (or the previous attribute, if the element already has
                        one
                        or more attributes).</li>
                    <li>The attribute name followed by an equal sign.</li>
                    <li>The attribute value wrapped by opening and closing quotation marks.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section class="main-section" id="nesting_elements">
                <header>Nesting Elements</header>
                <p>You can put elements inside other elements too — this is called <b>nesting</b>. If we wanted to state
                    that our
                    cat is <b>very</b> grumpy, we could wrap the word "very" in a <a
                        href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/strong"><code>&lt;strong&gt;</code></a>
                    element, which means that the word is to
                    be strongly emphasized:</p>
                <code class="code">&lt;p&gt;My cat is &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; grumpy.&lt;/p&gt;</code>
                <p>You do however need to make sure that your elements are properly nested. In the example above, we
                    opened
                    the <a><code>&lt;p&gt;</code></a> element first, then the <a><code>&lt;strong&gt;</code></a>
                    element;
                    therefore, we have to close the
                    <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> element first, then the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> element. The following is
                    incorrect:
                </p>
                <code
                    class="wrong-code">&lt;p&gt;My cat is &lt;strong&gt;very grumpy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; <i class="material-icons">&#xe001;</i></code>
                <p>The <b>tag have to open and close correctly so that they are clearly inside or outside one
                        another</b>.
                    With the kind of overlap in the example above, the browser has to guess at your intent. This kind of
                    guessing can result in unexpected results.</p>

            <section class="main-section" id="block_versus_inline_elements">

                <header>Block versus inline elements</header>
                <p>There are two important categories of elements to know in HTML: block-level elements and inline
                    elements.
                </p>
                <ul class="list-style-circle">
                    <li>Block-level elements form a visible block on a page. A block-level element appears on a new line
                        following the content that precedes it. Any content that follows a block-level element also
                        appears
                        on a new line. Block-level elements are usually structural elements on the page. For example, a
                        block-level element might represent headings, paragraphs, lists, navigation menus, or footers. A
                        block-level element wouldn't be nested inside an inline element, but it might be nested inside
                        another block-level element.</li>
                    <li>Inline elements are contained within block-level elements, and surround only small parts of the
                        document's content (not entire paragraphs or groupings of content). An inline element will not
                        cause
                        a new line to appear in the document. It is typically used with text, for example an <a
                            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a"><code>&lt;a&gt;</code></a>
                        element
                        creates a hyperlink, and elements such as <a
                            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/em"><code>&lt;em&gt;</code></a>>
                        or <a
                            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/strong"><code>&lt;strong&gt;</code></a>
                        create emphasis.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Consider the following example:</p>
                <code class="code">&lt;em&gt;first&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;second&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;third&lt;/em&gt;


                &lt;p&gt;fourth&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;fifth&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;sixth&lt;/p&gt;
            </code>
                <p><code><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/em">&lt;em&gt;</a></code>is
                    an
                    inline element. As you see below, the first three elements sit on the same line, with no space in
                    between. On the other hand,
                    <code><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/p">&lt;p&gt;</a></code> is
                    a
                    block-level element. Each <code><em>p</em></code> element appears on a new line, with space above
                    and
                    below. (The spacing
                    is due to default CSS styling that the browser applies to paragraphs.)
                </p>
            </section>

            <section class="main-section" id="void_elements">
                <header>Void Elements</header>
                <p>Some elements have no content and are called <a
                        href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Void_element">void elements</a>. Take
                    the
                    <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element that we already have in our HTML page:
                </p>
                <code class="code">&lt;img src="image/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image" /&gt; 
                </code>
                <p>This contains two attributes, but there is no closing <code>&lt;/img&gt;</code> tag and no inner
                    content. This is because an image element doesn't wrap content to affect it. Its purpose is to embed
                    an image in the HTML page in the place it appears.

                <p>That wraps up the basics of individual HTML elements, but they aren't handy on their own. Now we'll
                    look at how individual elements are combined to form an entire HTML page. Let's revisit the code we
                    put into our <code>index.html</code> example (which we first met in the <a

                </code>
                <p>Here, we have the following:</p>
                <ul class="list-style-number">
                    <li><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code> - <a
                            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Doctype">doctype</a>.It is a
                        required preamble. In the mists of time, when HTML was young (around 1991/92), doctypes were
                        meant to act as links to a set of rules that the HTML page had to follow to be considered good
                        HTML, which could mean automatic error checking and other useful things. However, these days,
                        they don't do much and are basically just needed to make sure your document behaves correctly.
                        That's all you need to know for now.</li>
                    <li><code>&lt;html&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</code> - the <a
                            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/html"><code>&lt;html&gt;</code></a>
                        element. This element wraps all the content on the entire page and is sometimes known as the
                        root element. It also includes the lang attribute, setting the primary language of the
                        document.</code></li>

                        element. This element acts as a container for all the stuff you want to include on the HTML page
                        that isn't the content you are showing to your page's viewers. This includes things like <a
                            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Keyword">keywords</a> and a page
                        description that you want to appear in search results, CSS to style our content, character set

                        any textual content it might contain. There is no reason not to set this, and it can help avoid
                        some problems later.
