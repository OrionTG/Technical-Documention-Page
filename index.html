            <p>At its heart, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTML">HTML</a> is a language
                made up of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Element">elements</a>, which can
                be applied to pieces of text to give them
                different meaning in a document (Is it a paragraph? Is it a bulleted list? Is it part of a table?),
                structure a document into logical sections (Does it have a header? Three columns of content? A
                navigation menu?), and embed content such as images and videos into a page. This module will introduce
                the first two of these and introduce fundamental concepts and syntax you need to know to understand
                HTML.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="what_is_html">
            <header>What is HTML?</header>
            <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a markup language that tells web browsers how to structure the web
                pages you visit. It can be as complicated or as simple as the web developer wants it to be. HTML
                consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, wrap, or mark up different parts of content
                to make it appear or act in a certain way. The enclosing tags can make content into a hyperlink to
                connect to another page, italicize words, and so on. For example, consider the following line of text:
            </p>
            <code class="code">My cat is very grumpy</code>
            <p>If we wanted the line to stand by itself, we could specify that it is a paragraph by enclosing it in
                paragraph tags:</p>
            <code class="code">&lt;p&gt;My cat is very grumpy&lt;p&gt;</code>
            <header>Anatomy of an HTML element</header>
            <p>Let's explore this paragraph element a bit further.</p>
            <img
                src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics/grumpy-cat-small.png" />
            <p>The main parts of our element are as follows:</p>
            <ul class="list-style-number">
                <li><b>The opening tag:</b> This consists of the name of the element (in this case, <code>p</code>),
                    wrapped in opening and
                    closing <b>angle brackets</b>. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in
                    this case
                    where the paragraph begins.</li>
                <li><b>The closing tag:</b> This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a <i>forward
                        slash</i> before
                    the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends.
                    Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results.
                </li>
                <li><b>The content:</b> This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.</li>
                <li><b>The element:</b> The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Elements can also have attributes that look like the following:</p>
            <img
                src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics/grumpy-cat-attribute-small.png" />
            <p>Attributes contain extra information about the element that you don't want to appear in the actual
                content. Here, <code>class</code> is the attribute name and <code>editor-note</code> is the attribute
                value. The <code>class</code> attribute
                allows you to give the element a non-unique identifier that can be used to target it (and any other
                elements with the same <code>class</code> value) with style information and other things.</p>
            <p>An attribute should always have the following:</p>
            <ul class="list-style-number">
                <li>A space between it and the element name (or the previous attribute, if the element already has one
                    or more attributes).</li>
                <li>The attribute name followed by an equal sign.</li>
                <li>The attribute value wrapped by opening and closing quotation marks.</li>
            </ul>
            <header>Nesting Elements</header>
            <p>You can put elements inside other elements too — this is called <b>nesting</b>. If we wanted to state
                that our
                cat is <b>very</b> grumpy, we could wrap the word "very" in a <a
                    href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/strong"><code>&lt;strong&gt;</code></a>
                element, which means that the word is to
                be strongly emphasized:</p>
            <code class="code">&lt;p&gt;My cat is &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; grumpy.&lt;/p&gt;</code>
            <p>You do however need to make sure that your elements are properly nested. In the example above, we opened
                the <a><code>&lt;p&gt;</code></a> element first, then the <a><code>&lt;strong&gt;</code></a> element;
                therefore, we have to close the
                <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> element first, then the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> element. The following is
                incorrect:
            </p>
            <code class="wrong-code">&lt;p&gt;My cat is &lt;strong&gt;very grumpy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;</code>
            <p>The <b>tag have to open and close correctly so that they are clearly inside or outside one another</b>.
                With the kind of overlap in the example above, the browser has to guess at your intent. This kind of
                guessing can result in unexpected results.</p>
            <header>Block versus inline elements</header>
            <p>There are two important categories of elements to know in HTML: block-level elements and inline elements.
            </p>
            <ul class="list-style-circle">
                <li>Block-level elements form a visible block on a page. A block-level element appears on a new line
                    following the content that precedes it. Any content that follows a block-level element also appears
                    on a new line. Block-level elements are usually structural elements on the page. For example, a
                    block-level element might represent headings, paragraphs, lists, navigation menus, or footers. A
                    block-level element wouldn't be nested inside an inline element, but it might be nested inside
                    another block-level element.</li>
                <li>Inline elements are contained within block-level elements, and surround only small parts of the
                    document's content (not entire paragraphs or groupings of content). An inline element will not cause
                    a new line to appear in the document. It is typically used with text, for example an <a
                        href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a"><code>&lt;a&gt;</code></a>
                    element
                    creates a hyperlink, and elements such as <a
                        href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/em"><code>&lt;em&gt;</code></a>>
                    or <a
                        href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/strong"><code>&lt;strong&gt;</code></a>
                    create emphasis.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Consider the following example:</p>
            <code class="code">&lt;em&gt;first&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;second&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;third&lt;/em&gt;


                &lt;p&gt;fourth&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;fifth&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;sixth&lt;/p&gt;
            </code>
            <p><code><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/em">&lt;em&gt;</a></code>is an inline element. As you see below, the first three elements sit on the same line, with no space in
                between. On the other hand,
            <code><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/p">&lt;p&gt;</a></code> is a block-level element. Each <code><em>p</em></code> element appears on a new line, with space above and below. (The spacing
                is due to default CSS styling that the browser applies to paragraphs.)</p>
            <header>Void Elements</header>
            <p></p>
            <p>Some elements have no content and are called <a
                    href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Void_element">void elements</a>. Take the
                <code>&lt;img&gt;</code>> element that we already have in our HTML page:
            </p>
